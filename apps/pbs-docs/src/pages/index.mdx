**Plain Bottom Sheet** is The **minimalistic**, **configurable** bottom-sheet for
the Web developers.

The core module is **built purely in TypeScript**, and that offers a lot of benefits such as:

- 🫙 <strong>It has zero dependencies</strong>, so your app does not depend on any other libraries that you don't need.
- 🪶 <strong>It's Super Lightweight(Only 30 Kb, compressed)</strong>, so you don't have to compromise loading speed.
- 📱 <strong>Mobile-friendly</strong>, works just like the native bottom sheet.
- 🦮 <strong>Accessibility Support</strong> out-of-box keyboard interactions and focus management.
- 🎛 <strong>Highly configurable</strong>, so you don't have to build another Bottom Sheet again.
  - Style it anyway you want, using CSS.
  - Change its behaviors.
  - Hook into life-cycle events, and states.
- 🍰 <strong>Works out of the box</strong> without any configs.
- 🦾 <strong>Fully-typed</strong>, and every prop is documented.
- ⚡️ <strong>Performant</strong> by default.
